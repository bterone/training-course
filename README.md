## About this Project
This project is my submission of a Ruby on Rails application. I completed this project over the course of two weeks with no prior knowledge in Ruby or Rails. A fun project nonetheless. It is an Online Training Course website where Users can follow their favorite courses and do classes while Instructors can give grades or assign users to groups. It makes use of Devise and Pundit for authorization.
